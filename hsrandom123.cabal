synopsis:             Counter-based Random Number Generators in Haskell
description:          This library contains pure Haskell implementations of the counter-based random-number
                      generators /Philox/ and /Threefry/ as described in the paper
                      .

                      The Philox and Threefry random number generators only use a counter as their state. As
                      such, they are easy to use in both parallel and distributed settings. They fare well in
                      classic PRNG tests such as Dieharder and Crush, however they are not suitable for use in
                      cryptography or security.
